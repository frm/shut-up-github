# Shut Up, GitHub!

This is the world's most useless extensions.

I use [octobox][octobox] to manage my GitHub Notifications. Which means that
when I go to GitHub, I don't want to have my OCD tickled by the notification
indicator.

I tried disabling the web notifications in settings but that means they won't
propagate to Octobox.

So I made this Firefox extension to remove the notification indicator from the
topbar.

And that's that. Cheerio.
